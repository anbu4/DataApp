Alongside the appearance of the gates, various humans were transformed into hunters and bestowed superhuman abilities. Responsible for entering the gates and clearing the dungeons within, many hunters chose to form guilds to secure their livelihoods.Sung Jin-Woo is an E-rank hunter dubbed as the weakest hunter of all mankind. While exploring a supposedly safe dungeon, he and his party encounter an unusual tunnel leading to a deeper area. Enticed by the prospect of treasure, the group presses forward, only to be confronted with horrors beyond their imagination. Miraculously, Jin-Woo survives the incident and soon finds that he now has access to an interface visible only to him.

The students enjoy an unparalleled amount of freedom, and it is ranked highly in Japan. However, the reality is less than ideal. Four classes, A through D, are ranked in order of merit, and only the top classes receive favorable treatment. Kiyotaka Ayanokouji is a student of Class D, where the school dumps its worst. There he meets the unsociable Suzune Horikita, who believes she was placed in Class D by mistake and desires to climb all the way to Class A, and the seemingly amicable class idol Kikyou Kushida, whose aim is to make as many friends as possible. While class membership is permanent, class rankings are not; students in lower ranked classes can rise in rankings if they score better than those in the top ones. Additionally, in Class D, there are no bars on what methods can be used to get ahead.

Alongside the appearance of the gates, various humans were transformed into hunters and bestowed superhuman abilities. Responsible for entering the gates and clearing the dungeons within, many hunters chose to form guilds to secure their livelihoods.Sung Jin-Woo is an E-rank hunter dubbed as the weakest hunter of all mankind. While exploring a supposedly safe dungeon, he and his party encounter an unusual tunnel leading to a deeper area. Enticed by the prospect of treasure, the group presses forward, only to be confronted with horrors beyond their imagination. Miraculously, Jin-Woo survives the incident and soon finds that he now has access to an interface visible only to him. This mysterious system promises him the power he has long dreamed of—but everything comes at a price.","videoUrl":{"1":"<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" src=\"https://dzen.ru/embed/vCzc2jpw4ezU\" allow=\"fullscreen; accelerometer; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; encrypted-media\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","2":"<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" src=\"https://dzen.ru/embed/v8n6sBIJNCys\" allow=\"fullscreen; accelerometer; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; encrypted-media\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","3":"<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" src=\"https://dzen.ru/embed/vvOPKCHHQg1A\" allow=\"fullscreen; accelerometer; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; encrypted-media\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","4":"<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" src=\"https://dzen.ru/embed/vnB61tZYYHmk\" allow=\"fullscreen; accelerometer; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; encrypted-media\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","5":"<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" src=\"https://dzen.ru/embed/v9_FcSThC_z0\" allow=\"fullscreen; accelerometer; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; encrypted-media\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","6":"<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" src=\"https://dzen.ru/embed/v5ncmIH1Tj0I\" allow=\"fullscreen; accelerometer; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; encrypted-media\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","7":"<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" src=\"https://dzen.ru/embed/vAy12bzE2EEg\" allow=\"fullscreen; accelerometer; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; encrypted-media\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","8":"<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" src=\"https://dzen.ru/embed/vpe2PpL38CyA\" allow=\"fullscreen; accelerometer; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; encrypted-media\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","9":"<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" src=\"https://dzen.ru/embed/vl3oF0uwnBFc\" allow=\"fullscreen; accelerometer; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; encrypted-media\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","10":"<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" src=\"https://dzen.ru/embed/vh45RwghBGzw\" allow=\"fullscreen; accelerometer; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; encrypted-media\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","11":"<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" src=\"https://dzen.ru/embed/vejRw5C8lNy8\" allow=\"fullscreen; accelerometer; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; encrypted-media\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","12":"<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" src=\"https://dzen.ru/embed/vcEE3z9JsOhY\" allow=\"fullscreen; accelerometer; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; encrypted-media\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen></iframe>"}},{"id":4,"title":"Classroom of the Elite","episodes":12,"year":2017,"count":"Japan","genre":["Dramas","School","Psychological"],"category":"anime","cardImg":"https://pibig.info/uploads/posts/2022-11/1668755480_9-pibig-info-p-personazhi-klass-prevoskhodstva-instagram-9.jpg","slaydImg":"https://virtus-img.cdnvideo.ru/images/og-jpg/plain/c8/c8b89fe3-1c44-42fb-bf6d-10252feebcb9.webp","summary":"On the surface, Koudo Ikusei Senior High School is a utopia. The students enjoy an unparalleled amount of freedom, and it is ranked highly in Japan. However, the reality is less than ideal. Four classes, A through D, are ranked in order of merit, and only the top classes receive favorable treatment. Kiyotaka Ayanokouji is a student of Class D, where the school dumps its worst. There he meets the unsociable Suzune Horikita, who believes she was placed in Class D by mistake and desires to climb all the way to Class A, and the seemingly amicable class idol Kikyou Kushida, whose aim is to make as many friends as possible. While class membership is permanent, class rankings are not; students in lower ranked classes can rise in rankings if they score better than those in the top ones. Additionally, in Class D, there are no bars on what methods can be used to get ahead. In this cutthroat school, can they prevail against the odds and reach the top?","videoUrl":{"1":"<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" src=\"https://dzen.ru/embed/vP8OMkDEpDws\" allow=\"fullscreen; accelerometer; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; encrypted-media\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","2":"<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" src=\"https://dzen.ru/embed/vBSLHa5fhgwY\" allow=\"fullscreen; accelerometer; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; encrypted-media\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","3":"<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" src=\"https://dzen.ru/embed/vMi51qjEiFhU\" allow=\"fullscreen; accelerometer; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; encrypted-media\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","4":"<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" src=\"https://dzen.ru/embed/vWW6YbChTiyc\" allow=\"fullscreen; accelerometer; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; encrypted-media\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","5":"<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" src=\"https://dzen.ru/embed/vBNNlyz1qtF4\" allow=\"fullscreen; accelerometer; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; encrypted-media\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","6":"<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" src=\"https://dzen.ru/embed/v7UOabUktDSM\" allow=\"fullscreen; accelerometer; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; encrypted-media\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","7":"<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" src=\"https://dzen.ru/embed/vZQNQIyZBzTM\" allow=\"fullscreen; accelerometer; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; encrypted-media\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","8":"<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" src=\"https://dzen.ru/embed/vXRsaFzmE0mE\" allow=\"fullscreen; accelerometer; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; encrypted-media\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","9":"<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" src=\"https://dzen.ru/embed/vMw6LS9u2EHw\" allow=\"fullscreen; accelerometer; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; encrypted-media\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","10":"<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" src=\"https://dzen.ru/embed/v6D88eV91gWU\" allow=\"fullscreen; accelerometer; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; encrypted-media\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","11":"<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" src=\"https://dzen.ru/embed/v8Z9jipysYXw\" allow=\"fullscreen; accelerometer; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; encrypted-media\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","12":"<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" src=\"https://dzen.ru/embed/vsd12--fBZ2M\" allow=\"fullscreen; accelerometer; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; encrypted-media\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen></iframe>"}}]}'
