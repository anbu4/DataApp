Her father remarried, and her younger half-sister Kaya received all the affection, while Miyo was degraded to a lowly servant. Lacking the strength to fight against her familys abuse, Miyo loses hope that her luck will ever turn. Unexpectedly, Miyos father summons her to deliver surprising news: she is to marry Kiyoka Kudou, the head of the distinguished Kudou family. Despite his noble background, Kiyoka is known to be a callous man who has thus far dismissed all of his former fiancées. Upon arriving at the Kudou household, Miyo expects coarse treatment and to be tossed aside. However, contrary to her assumptions, Kiyoka shows her the kindness and love that she has desperately needed. Marrying Kiyoka may be Miyos one chance to break free from her neglectful family and embrace a life of happiness.",

Alongside the appearance of the gates, various humans were transformed into hunters and bestowed superhuman abilities. Responsible for entering the gates and clearing the dungeons within, many hunters chose to form guilds to secure their livelihoods.Sung Jin-Woo is an E-rank hunter dubbed as the weakest hunter of all mankind. While exploring a supposedly safe dungeon, he and his party encounter an unusual tunnel leading to a deeper area. Enticed by the prospect of treasure, the group presses forward, only to be confronted with horrors beyond their imagination. Miraculously, Jin-Woo survives the incident and soon finds that he now has access to an interface visible only to him. This mysterious system promises him the power he has long dreamed of—but everything comes at a price.",

However, the reality is less than ideal. Four classes, A through D, are ranked in order of merit, and only the top classes receive favorable treatment. Kiyotaka Ayanokouji is a student of Class D, where the school dumps its worst. There he meets the unsociable Suzune Horikita, who believes she was placed in Class D by mistake and desires to climb all the way to Class A, and the seemingly amicable class idol Kikyou Kushida, whose aim is to make as many friends as possible. While class membership is permanent, class rankings are not; students in lower ranked classes can rise in rankings if they score better than those in the top ones. Additionally, in Class D, there are no bars on what methods can be used to get ahead. In this cutthroat school, can they prevail against the odds and reach the top?",

All this is not about our protagonist Sid, because he has always admired people from behind the scenes, those who almost do not take any action in the open, but appear only at the most crucial moment and, having done the job, disappears without a trace. In our world, it is difficult to pull off such a thing, because no matter what you do, you can't go against the atomic bomb. And so, thinking about ways to repel nuclear weapons with his bare hands, our hero comes to the conclusion that there is no way without magic. Conveniently it turned out, because soon after that the guy met the notorious truck, which sent him to the other world, or to be more precise, to the world full of swords, magic and other delights of fantasy universes. Now Sid will have no obstacles on his way to becoming the greatest ruler from the shadows. Translated with DeepL.com (free version)",

Gamers got the opportunity of complete immersion. The novelty became the most expected and ten thousand samples with lightning speed disappeared from the shelves. Everyone entered reality, dissolved into it and gathered in the City. The creator appeared. A huge black shadow explained to the participants that it was possible to return to the real world only by going through the whole game. But there is one cruel moment, virtual death means death in real life and it is impossible to pass it at random. After the loud words the creator vaporized, leaving the players alone.\r\n\r\nThe reaction to the message was different. Desperation set in, some teamed up with others, and some, like Kazuto's character, went it alone. Kirigaya is an orphan and so once in this world, he loses nothing. He is a beta tester and knowing everything about the game, he quickly gained popularity with the players. The hero realizes that without interaction with others he can not get out and has to establish contacts with other players. And while the swordfight is going on, everyone will see a lot of amazing things.",

Lacking the strength to fight against her familys abuse, Miyo loses hope that her luck will ever turn. Unexpectedly, Miyos father summons her to deliver surprising news: she is to marry Kiyoka Kudou, the head of the distinguished Kudou family. Despite his noble background, Kiyoka is known to be a callous man who has thus far dismissed all of his former fiancées. Upon arriving at the Kudou household, Miyo expects coarse treatment and to be tossed aside. However, contrary to her assumptions, Kiyoka shows her the kindness and love that she has desperately needed. Marrying Kiyoka may be Miyos one chance to break free from her neglectful family and embrace a life of happiness.",

            "summary": "Humanity was caught at a precipice a decade ago when the first gates—portals linked with other dimensions that harbor monsters immune to conventional weaponry—emerged around the world. Alongside the appearance of the gates, various humans were transformed into hunters and bestowed superhuman abilities. Responsible for entering the gates and clearing the dungeons within, many hunters chose to form guilds to secure their livelihoods.Sung Jin-Woo is an E-rank hunter dubbed as the weakest hunter of all mankind. While exploring a supposedly safe dungeon, he and his party encounter an unusual tunnel leading to a deeper area. Enticed by the prospect of treasure, the group presses forward, only to be confronted with horrors beyond their imagination. Miraculously, Jin-Woo survives the incident and soon finds that he now has access to an interface visible only to him. This mysterious system promises him the power he has long dreamed of—but everything comes at a price.",

However, the reality is less than ideal. Four classes, A through D, are ranked in order of merit, and only the top classes receive favorable treatment. Kiyotaka Ayanokouji is a student of Class D, where the school dumps its worst. There he meets the unsociable Suzune Horikita, who believes she was placed in Class D by mistake and desires to climb all the way to Class A, and the seemingly amicable class idol Kikyou Kushida, whose aim is to make as many friends as possible. While class membership is permanent, class rankings are not; students in lower ranked classes can rise in rankings if they score better than those in the top ones. Additionally, in Class D, there are no bars on what methods can be used to get ahead. In this cutthroat school, can they prevail against the odds and reach the top?",

All this is not about our protagonist Sid, because he has always admired people from behind the scenes, those who almost do not take any action in the open, but appear only at the most crucial moment and, having done the job, disappears without a trace. In our world, it is difficult to pull off such a thing, because no matter what you do, you can't go against the atomic bomb. And so, thinking about ways to repel nuclear weapons with his bare hands, our hero comes to the conclusion that there is no way without magic. Conveniently it turned out, because soon after that the guy met the notorious truck, which sent him to the other world, or to be more precise, to the world full of swords, magic and other delights of fantasy universes. Now Sid will have no obstacles on his way to becoming the greatest ruler from the shadows. Translated with DeepL.com (free version)",

Gamers got the opportunity of complete immersion. The novelty became the most expected and ten thousand samples with lightning speed disappeared from the shelves. Everyone entered reality, dissolved into it and gathered in the City. The creator appeared. A huge black shadow explained to the participants that it was possible to return to the real world only by going through the whole game. But there is one cruel moment, virtual death means death in real life and it is impossible to pass it at random. After the loud words the creator vaporized, leaving the players alone.\r\n\r\nThe reaction to the message was different. Desperation set in, some teamed up with others, and some, like Kazuto's character, went it alone. Kirigaya is an orphan and so once in this world, he loses nothing. He is a beta tester and knowing everything about the game, he quickly gained popularity with the players. The hero realizes that without interaction with others he can not get out and has to establish contacts with other players. And while the swordfight is going on, everyone will see a lot of amazing things.",
